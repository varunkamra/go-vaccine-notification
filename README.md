# go-vaccine-notification

Used CoWin public access api to create a script that will notify when a vaccine is avalable.
For notifications I used [gen2brain/beeep](https://github.com/gen2brain/beeep) which does the job well.
Also, created an exe file which can be used to create a windows task scheduler which can run at specified intervals throughout the day.
